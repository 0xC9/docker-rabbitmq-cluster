This folder structure contains the Dockerfiles for building RabbitMQ cluster - the number of nodes are completely customizable using a fig.yml file.


Structure:
==========
There are 3 folders.

1. base - this is the base Dockerfile which builds on a CentOS image and installs the RabbitMQ binaries on the image
2. server - This builds on the base image and has the startup script for bring up a RabbitMQ server
4. cluster - This contains a http://www.fig.sh/index.html[fig] definition file(fig.yml) for brining up the rabbitmq cluster. Use `fig up -d` to bring up the cluster.



Running the Cluster:
===============================
Once the images are built, boot up the cluster using the fig.yml configuration provided in cluster folder:    

[source]
----
fig up -d
----

By default 3 nodes are started up this way:

[source]
----
rabbit1:
  image: bijukunjummen/rabbitmq-server
  hostname: rabbit1
  ports:
    - "5672:5672"
    - "15672:15672"

rabbit2:
  image: bijukunjummen/rabbitmq-server
  hostname: rabbit2
  links:
    - rabbit1
  environment: 
   - CLUSTERED=true
   - CLUSTER_WITH=rabbit1
   - RAM_NODE=true

rabbit3:
  image: bijukunjummen/rabbitmq-server
  hostname: rabbit3
  links:
    - rabbit1
    - rabbit2
  environment: 
   - CLUSTERED=true
   - CLUSTER_WITH=rabbit1   
----

if needed, additional nodes can be added to this file
